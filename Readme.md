# Rust App Framework

As software engineers, we dislike frameworks. They are opinionated, hard to learn, hard to extend and hard to maintain.
We prefer libraries. Libraries are easy to learn, easy to extend and easy to maintain. 
But libraries are not enough. We need a framework to glue them together. This is a framework to glue libraries together.

Also, this is a proof of concept on how much I can achieve with Rust. 
I am not a Rust expert, so I am sure there are better ways to do things. I am open to suggestions.

My goals are:
- Learn Rust
- Learn how to build a framework while trying to keep it as close to a library as possible.
- Learn how to build a high performance framework.
